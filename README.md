# The Simple Typeahead Search Bar

Available here: https://simple-typeahead-react.vercel.app/

This was a quick project to familiarize myself with creating typeahead search bars using just React and `styled-components` while attempting to follow Google's Material Design found [here](https://material.io/design/navigation/search.html).

Features include:

- Persistent and Expandable search bar
- Bolded untyped characters in the suggested results
- Autocomplete searchable items on click of a result
- Focused state changes icon to clear button that clears field

Stuff i'd want to add:

- Tap arrow to unfocus
- Keyboard navigation of results
